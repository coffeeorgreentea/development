# üçå Development model for Banana

This repo gives a basic framework for serving arbitrary code on Banana.  I use this to test code I wish to turn into it's own standalone model.

It can be used as an alternative to having full E2E development locally (if you don't have a GPU), or a deployment framework like brev.

# Quickstart

Deploy this model via the one-click template [here]((https://app.banana.dev/templates/djt/development).

You will also find the model inputs and outputs to help get you going.

# Helpful Links
Understand the üçå [Serverless framework](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/core-concepts/inference-server/serverless-framework) and functionality of each file within it.

Generalize this framework to [deploy anything on Banana](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/resources/how-to-serve-anything-on-banana).

## Use Banana for scale.
